        I'm currently a dog walker during the day and study at Code Fellows in the evening. I was born in Yokuska
        Japan and grew up in Northeast Ohio. My family relocated to the Northwest when I was a Sophmore in high school.
        I discovered my love of technology early in my high school career and spent countless hours watching and
        rewatching episodes of Screen Savers on TechTV. I focused on graphic design in high school and got a job at a
        custom t-shirt shop to refine my skills shortly after graduation.<br><br>

        My love of technology continued through college where I focused on Journalism and Graphic design. My graphic design work
        has been published in The New Yorker and MacWorld as well as a number of small newspapers on the Olympic Peninsula. In
        my free time I enjoy long walks through record stores, tattoos, baking and science fiction.<br><br>

        I aspire to become a full time developer focusing on python.<br><br>
