    I'm currently a dog walker during the day and study at Code Fellows in the evening. I was born in Yokuska
    Japan and grew up in Northeast Ohio. My family relocated to the Northwest when I was a Sophmore in high school.
    I discovered my love of technology early in my high school career and spent countless hours watching and
    rewatching episodes of Screen Savers on TechTV. I focused on graphic design in high school and got a job at a
    custom t-shirt shop to refine my skills shortly after graduation.

    My love of technology continued through college where I focused on Journalism and Graphic design. My graphic design work
    has been published in The New Yorker and MacWorld as well as a number of small newspapers on the Olympic Peninsula. In
    my free time I enjoy long walks through record stores, tattoos, baking and science fiction.

    I aspire to become a full time developer focusing on python.
